## Create an Issue

Before submitting a pull request, it is **strongly recommended** to create an issue first to discuss your proposed changes. This will help us to make sure that your changes are aligned with the project goals and that you are not duplicating work that is already in progress.

If you are not sure whether your changes are needed, feel free to create an issue anyway and we can discuss it there. Once we have agreed on the changes, you can start working on them.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please note that we are in the process of setting up a formal Contributor License Agreement (CLA). While not yet required, a CLA will be implemented in the near future to ensure the project remains freely available to all. We appreciate your understanding as we finalize this process.
