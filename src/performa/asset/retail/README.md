# Performa Retail Asset Models - Shopping Center & Retail Property Analysis

This module will provide comprehensive modeling capabilities for retail properties,
including shopping centers, strip malls, power centers, and standalone retail buildings.

## Planned Features

### Core Models (Future Implementation)
- **RetailProperty**: Main property container with tenant mix and retail operations
- **RetailLease**: Commercial lease model with retail-specific terms (percentage rent, CAM, etc.)
- **RetailAnalysisScenario**: Analysis orchestration for retail cash flows

### Retail-Specific Components
- Percentage rent modeling with sales breakpoints
- Common Area Maintenance (CAM) charges and reconciliation
- Tenant mix optimization and category management
- Anchor tenant and inline tenant differentiation
- Marketing fund and promotional assessments

### Lease Structure
- Base rent plus percentage rent calculations
- Triple net lease structures with expense recoveries
- Tenant improvement allowances for retail buildouts
- Co-tenancy clauses and opening/operating requirements
- Lease renewal and expansion options

### Key Features (Planned)
- Sales per square foot analysis and benchmarking
- Percentage rent optimization and breakpoint management
- Retail rollover modeling with tenant category considerations
- CAM expense allocation and recovery calculations
- Development modeling for new shopping centers

## Integration

Will integrate with existing Performa modules:
- **Core primitives** for timeline and cash flow modeling
- **Base classes** for lease and recovery modeling
- **Development module** for retail construction projects
- **Valuation module** for retail-specific metrics

## Status

**Planned for future implementation**
