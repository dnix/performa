# Performa Industrial Asset Models - Warehouse & Distribution Property Analysis

This module will provide comprehensive modeling capabilities for industrial
properties, including warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities,
and flex/R&D spaces.

## Planned Features

### Core Models (Future Implementation)
- **IndustrialProperty**: Main property container with tenant mix and industrial operations
- **IndustrialLease**: Commercial lease model with industrial-specific terms (NNN, gross, modified gross)
- **IndustrialAnalysisScenario**: Analysis orchestration for industrial cash flows

### Industrial-Specific Components
- Single-tenant and multi-tenant warehouse modeling
- Clear height and loading dock specifications
- Build-to-suit and speculative development scenarios
- Industrial-specific expense categories (utilities, maintenance, security)
- Environmental compliance and remediation considerations

### Lease Structure
- Triple net lease structures predominant in industrial
- Long-term lease agreements with minimal landlord services
- Tenant improvement considerations for industrial buildouts
- Renewal options and expansion rights for growing tenants
- CPI-based escalations common in industrial leases

### Key Features (Planned)
- Distribution center and logistics facility modeling
- Manufacturing facility cash flow analysis
- Flex/R&D space with office component integration
- Industrial development modeling with pre-leasing scenarios
- Transportation and logistics cost considerations

## Integration

Will integrate with existing Performa modules:
- **Core primitives** for timeline and cash flow modeling
- **Base classes** for lease and property modeling
- **Development module** for build-to-suit projects
- **Valuation module** for industrial-specific metrics

## Status

**Planned for future implementation**
